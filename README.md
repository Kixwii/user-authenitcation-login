# user-authenitcation-login
This is a user suthnetication/ login page. It performs the basic functionality of a regular login page by allowing the user to login using both their email or the password that was previously set during registeration.
Should the user not have an account, the page prompts the user to create an account and redirects the user to a registeration page.
